## Description
This was an individual code challenge that i worked on during my python phase.The challenge really made made put into practice the whole week content.

## Installation Requirements.
- Either a computer, phone, tablet or an Ipad
- Access to the Internet

## Installation Process

**git clone the repository to your local machine using the command**

```
$ 'git@github.com:Hellenwamaitha/python-1-challange.git'
```

**Navigate to the project using the command cd**
```
$ 'cd pytho-1-challenge'
```
**Open the code using visualcode platform**

## Technologies Used
This challenge was mainly based on
- python

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:
  - Time.py -question on Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
  - Number.py -question on Two numbers are positive
  - Constant.py - question on Consonant value
  - Readme file
  
      ## Time.py -question on Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time.
The convert_to_24_hour function is a utility for converting time from 12-hour format to 24-hour format. It takes three parameters: hour, minute, and period. The function returns a formatted string representing the time in 24-hour format.
 
      ## Number.py -question on Two numbers are positive.
The two_numbers function is a utility for checking if at least two out of three input numbers are positive. It takes three parameters: a, b, and c. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the condition is met.

       ## constant.py question on Consonant value.
 The function calculates the cumulative value of a sequence of consecutive non-vowel characters in the input string. The calculated value for each character is determined by its position in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).Vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') interrupt the accumulation of the value, and the process restarts from the next character. The maximum constant value among all sequences is returned as the final result.
